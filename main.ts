// //*Question 19:* Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through
// // 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
// //*Explain & TIP:* Arrays have a length property that tells you how many items are in the list. 
// //Use this to inform your guests how big the party will be.

// let guests: string[] = ["sana jameel", "Mariya akram", "sara malik", "saqib ahmad", "khadija"];
// console.log(`I am inviting ${guests.length} people to dinner.`);


// //*Question 20:* Think of something you could store in an array.
//  //For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else
//   //youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// //*Explain & TIP:* Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like
//  //and list several examples.

// let countries: string[] = ["Turky", "Canada", "New Zealand", "Pakistan", "Switzerland"];
// console.log("Countries I'd like to visit:", countries);


// //*Question 21:* Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates 
// //Objects containing these items.
// //*Explain & TIP:* Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. 
// //Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car.


// let book: { title: string; author: string; yearPublished: number } = {
//     title: "The Hobbit",
//     author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
//     yearPublished: 1937
// };
// console.log(`Book Info: ${book.title} by ${book.author}, published in ${book.yearPublished}`);
